Net::LDAP::Search - Object returned by Net::LDAP search method

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Net::LDAP;
  
  $mesg = $ldap->search( @search_args );
  
  @entries = $mesg->entries;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A B<Net::LDAP::Search> object is returned from the
L<search|Net::LDAP/item_search> method of a L<Net::LDAP|Net::LDAP>
object. It is a container object which holds the results of the search.

B<Net::LDAP::Search> inherits from L<Net::LDAP::Message|Net::LDAP::Message>, and so supports
all methods defined in L<Net::LDAP::Message|Net::LDAP::Message>.

=item as_struct

Returns a reference to a HASH, where the keys are the DN's of the results
and the values are HASH references. These second level HASH's hold the
attributes such that the keys are the attribute names, in lowercase, and
the values are references to and ARRAY holding the values.

This method will block until the whole search request has finished.

=item count

Returns the number of entries returned by the server.

This method will block until the whole search request has finished.

=item entry ( INDEX )

Return the N'th entry, which will be a L<Net::LDAP::Entry|Net::LDAP::Entry> object. If
INDEX is greater than the total number of entries returned then
undef will be returned.

This method will block until the search request has returned enough
entries.

=item entries

Return an array of L<Net::LDAP::Entry|Net::LDAP::Entry> objects hat were returned from the
server.

=item pop_entry

Pop an entry from the internal list of L<Net::LDAP::Entry|Net::LDAP::Entry> objects for this
search. If there are not more entries then undef is returned.

This call will block, if the list is empty, until the server returns
another entry.

=item references

Return a list of references that the server returned. This will be a list
of L<Net::LDAP::Reference|Net::LDAP::Reference> objects.

=item sorted ( [ ATTR ] )

Return a list of L<Net::LDAP::Entry|Net::LDAP::Entry> objects, sorted by ATTR. If ATTR is
not given then the entries will be sorted by their DN.
