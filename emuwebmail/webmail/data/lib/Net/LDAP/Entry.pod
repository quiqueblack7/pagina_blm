Net::LDAP::Entry - An LDAP entry object

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Net::LDAP;

  $ldap = Net::LDAP->new($host);
  $mesg = $ldap->search(@search_args);

  my $max = $mesg->count;
  for($i = 0 ; $i < $max ; $i++) {
    my $entry = $mesg->entry($i);
    foreach my $attr ($entry->attributes) {
      print join("\n ",$attr, $entry->get_value($attr)),"\n";
    }
  }

  # or

  use Net::LDAP::Entry;
  
  $entry = Net::LDAP::Entry->new;
  
  $entry->add(
    attr1 => 'value1',
    attr2 => [qw(value1 value2)]
  );
  
  $entry->delete( 'unwanted' );
  
  $entry->replace(
    attr1 => 'newvalue'
    attr2 => [qw(new values)]
  );
  
  $entry->update( $ldap ); # update directory server

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<Net::LDAP::Entry> object represents a single entry in the directory.
It is a container for attribute-value pairs.

A B<Net::LDAP::Entry> object can be used in two situations. The first and
probably most common use is in the result of a search to the directory
server.

The other is where a new object is created locally and then a single
command is sent to the directory server to add, modify or replace an
entry. Entries for this purpose can also be created by reading an
LDIF file with the L<Net::LDAP::LDIF|Net::LDAP::LDIF> module.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=over 4

=item new

Create a new entry object with the changetype set to C<'add'>

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 4



=item add ( ATTR => VALUE [, ATTR2 => VALUE2 ... ] )

Add one or more new attributes to the entry. Each value
must be a scalar variable or a reference to an array. The
values given will be added to the values which already exist
for the given attributes.

  $entry->add( 'sn' => 'Barr');

  $entry->add( 'street' => [ '1 some road','nowhere']);

B<NOTE>: these changes are local to the client and will not
appear on the directory server until the C<update> method
is called.



=item attributes ( [ OPTIONS ] )

Return a list of attributes that this entry has.

OPTIONS is a list of name/value pairs, valid options are :-

=over 4

=item nooptions

If TRUE, return a list of the attribute names excluding any options. For example for the entry

  name: Graham Barr
  name;en-us: Bob
  jpeg;binary: **binary data**

the return list would be C<( 'name', 'jpeg' )>.

=back



=item changetype ( [ TYPE ] )

If called without arguments it returns the type of operation that would
be performed when the update method is called. If called with an argument
it will set the changetype to TYPE.

Possible values for TYPE are

=over 4

=item add

The update method will call the add method on the client object, which
will result in the entry being added to the directory server.

=item delete

The update method will call the delete method on the client object, which
will result in the entry being removed from the directory server.

=item modify

The update method will call the modify method on the client object, which
will result in any changes that have been made locally being made to the
entry on the directory server.

=back



=item delete ( [ ATTR [, ATTR2 ... ]] )

Delete the given attributes from the entry. If no attributes
are passed then the next call to update will cause the entry
to be deleted from the server.

B<NOTE>: these changes are local to the client and will not
appear on the directory server until the C<update> method
is called.



=item dn ( [ DN ] )

Set or get the DN for the entry. With no arguments C<dn> will return
the current DN. If an argument is given then it will change the DN
for the entry and return the previous value.

B<NOTE>: these changes are local to the client and will not
appear on the directory server until the C<update> method
is called.



=item exists ( ATTR )

Returns TRUE if the entry has an attribute called ATTR.



=item get_value ( ATTR [, OPTIONS ] )

Get the values for the attribute ATTR. In a list context returns all
values for the given attribute, or the empty list if the attribute does
not exist. In a scalar context returns the first value for the attribute
or undef if the attribute does not exist.

The return value may be changed by OPTIONS, which is a list of name => value
pairs, valid options are :-

=over 4

=item alloptions

If TRUE then the result will be a hash reference. The keys of the hash
will be the options and the hash value will be the values for those attributes.
For example if an entry had

  name: Graham Barr
  name;en-us: Bob

Then a get for attribute "name" with alloptions set would return 

  {
    ''       => [ 'Graham Barr' ],
    ';en-us' => [ 'Bob' ]
  }

=item asref

If TRUE then the result will be a reference to an array containing all the
values for the attribute, or undef if the attribute does not exist.

=back

B<NOTE>: In the interest of performance the array references returned by C<get_value>
are references to structures held inside the entry object. These values and
thier contents should B<NOT> be modified directly.



=item replace ( ATTR => VALUE [, ATTR2 => VALUE2 ... ] )

Similar to add, except that the values given will replace
any values that already exist for the given attributes.

B<NOTE>: these changes are local to the client and will not
appear on the directory server until the C<update> method
is called.



=item update ( CLIENT )

Update the directory server with any changes that have been made locally
to the attributes of this entry. This means any calls that have been
made to add, replace or delete since the last call to changetype or
update was made.

This method B<cannot> be used to modify the DN of the entry on the server,
for that see the C<moddn> method in L<Net::LDAP|Net::LDAP>.

CLIENT is a C<Net::LDAP> object where the update will be sent to.

The result will be an object of type
L<Net::LDAP::Message|Net::LDAP::Message> as returned by the add, modify
or delete method called on CLIENT.
